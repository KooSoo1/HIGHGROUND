Stattic is a lightweight and powerful **static site generator** designed for developers, freelancers, and small businesses looking for an easy-to-use, fast, and secure solution for building websites. Instead of dealing with complex databases, heavy server-side processing, and constant updates, Stattic focuses on simplicity and performance by generating static HTML files that can be served anywhere, whether it's a CDN, cloud storage, or a basic web server.

Stattic was built with modern web standards in mind and provides flexibility for customization without overwhelming you with bloat. Whether you are creating a blog, portfolio, marketing site, or a documentation platform, Stattic can handle it all while giving you full control over your site's performance and scalability.

### Who is Stattic For?

- **Developers** who are tired of the complexities and security concerns of dynamic content management systems and want to build something that just works.
- **Freelancers** who want a reliable platform for creating client websites without worrying about constant maintenance.
- **Small Business Owners** looking for a simple, cost-effective way to have an online presence without the headaches of server management or expensive hosting solutions.
- **Tech-savvy Content Creators** who want more control over their site's speed and performance while still maintaining an easy workflow for content updates.

## Why Stattic?

The web doesn't need more bloat. It needs speed, simplicity, and security. 

Stattic was built as a response to the mess that modern CMSs have become - bloated, fragile, and overengineered. With Stattic, you skip the complexity, cut the load time, and leave server-side vulnerabilities behind.

## How Stattic Works

Stattic generates static HTML pages based on your content (Markdown files), templates, and assets (CSS, JavaScript, images). It combines the simplicity of writing content in Markdown with the power of Jinja2 templating for rendering custom designs. 

Here's how it works in a nutshell:
1. **Markdown for Content**: You write your content in Markdown files, which are then parsed by Stattic.
2. **Templates**: Design your site using customizable templates powered by Jinja2.
3. **Assets**: Include your stylesheets, fonts, and scripts as static files, which Stattic automatically optimizes and integrates.
4. **Build Process**: Run the build process, and Stattic will generate a set of static HTML files that you can host anywhere, from GitHub Pages to a traditional web host.
5. **Performance**: Because Stattic outputs static files, your site is incredibly fast, without the need for a database or heavy server-side processing.

## The Future of Stattic

There will ongoing development, including:
- Adding more customizable templates.
- Offering even more flexibility in content management.
- Improving support for modern web technologies (e.g., JAMstack integrations, API-driven content).
- Providing robust documentation and support to help developers of all skill levels build amazing websites.

Whether you're looking to leave behind the complexities of CMSs or simply want to experiment with static sites, Stattic is here to empower you. We believe the future of the web is **faster**, **lighter**, and **more secure**, and Stattic is built to lead that future.

Thank you for being part of our journey!
